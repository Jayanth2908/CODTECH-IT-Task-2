## Overview of the Project
### Project: STUDENT GRADE TRACKER

### Project Description:
The Student Grade Tracker is a Java application designed to help users manage and analyze student grades. Users can enter multiple grades, and the application will calculate the average grade, determine the corresponding letter grade, and compute a GPA based on the letter grade.

**Tools and Technologies:**

**Java Development Kit (JDK):** The primary tool for writing and compiling Java programs.

**Integrated Development Environment (IDE):** An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans will be used for coding and debugging.

**Java Standard Library:** Utilized for input/output operations and basic arithmetic calculations.

## Key Activities:
**Project Setup:**

Install Java Development Kit (JDK).

Set up an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

**Program Design:**

Define the structure of the grade tracker.

Plan the user interface for input and output.

**Coding the Application:**

Create a Java class for the grade tracker.

Implement methods for capturing grades, calculating the average grade, determining the letter grade, and computing the GPA.

**User Input and Validation:**

Use Scanner class for capturing user inputs.

Validate inputs to ensure they are numerical and handle any exceptions for invalid inputs.

**Calculations:**

Implement the logic to calculate the average grade.

Implement methods to determine the letter grade based on the average grade.

Implement methods to calculate the GPA based on the letter grade.

**Displaying Results:**

Output the number of grades, average grade, letter grade, and GPA to the user.

Provide a summary of the entered grades.

**Testing and Debugging:**

Test the grade tracker with different inputs.

Debug any issues and ensure the program runs smoothly.
